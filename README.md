# ForgeMind

**ForgeMind** is a 100% offline, open-source mobile app that empowers anyone to generate real, functional code from natural language promptsâ€”without internet, accounts, or data tracking.

Built to withstand infrastructure failure, cyberattacks, or censorship, ForgeMind preserves the most critical GPT-like functionality for human progress: reliable code generation. It runs locally using a compact, embedded LLM.

## Features
- Runs entirely offline
- No internet, no accounts, no tracking
- Flutter-based UI with `llama.cpp` backend
- Uses quantized GGUF models like `Phi-2` or `TinyLLaMA`
- Outputs functional code (Python, etc.) from natural prompts
